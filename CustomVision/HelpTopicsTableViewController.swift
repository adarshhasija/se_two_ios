The user types in morse code by doing gestures anywhere on the screen. There is no need to be able to see the screen. As the user does gestures, the app confirms what has been typed by tapping the user on the wrist.\n\nTo find out what another person has said in English, the deaf-blind user simply scrolls through the morse code. The app will tap them on the wrist to tell them what has been said.\n\nThis is communicating through touch/taps on the wrist.\n\nWe highly recommend that a guardian/caregiver try out the app before giving it to the deaf-blind user.")

        answer: "The user can type in morse code. If the user taps the screen, they get a dot and the watch will tap their wrist once to confirm that. If they swipe right, they get a dash and the app will tap their wrist twice to confirm this. Like this they can write a message in morse code which the app will convert to English and play an audio for the other person.\n\nThe other person can then reply on the watch in English and the app will convert it to morse code. When the deaf-blind user scrolls through the morse code, the app will again tap once for dot and twice for dash to help the user understand what was said in English.\n\nWe highly recoomend that a guardian/caregiver try out the app before giving it to the deaf-blind user.\n\nAlso note that it is not neccessary to see the screen. One can tap anywhere on the screen")

It will help them understand how to use the app. For example: Once the deaf-blind user has typed out a message in morse code, the hint will inform the caregiver to lightly long press on the screen to reply in English\n\nWe highly recommend that a guardian/caregiver user these hints to understand how to use this app before giving it to the deaf-blind user.")

Instead of passing one device from one person to another for a conversation, each person can sit comfortably with one device. In a conversation session, the hearing-imapired person will type while the other person will speak and record their voice.
